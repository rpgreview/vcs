Welcome to ADMP, a d20 DM Combat Program. This is a combat program for AD&D v3.5. 
It is not a character generator or a campaign program ... just combat. 

This program will not do everything, AD&D is too complicated for that but I've tried to go for the 80/20 Rule ... 
80% of the rules for 20% of the effort.  So, I'm lazy ... sue me ;)

        This program will be updated on this site:
                http://scatha.scificities.com/ or http://zoe.ipgn.com.au/vcs/

This program is under constant development, please check the todo.txt file for changes.


Ok, how to use this dread .. err .. wonderful program .... ;)

- Go to the System tab and set all the flags, file names etc as required.
  Set the map size in the System tab as required and press the New button if you've changed the size.
- Add all the players in the Edit/Add tab.
- In the Combat draw the map. Set the "Map Mode" (middle LHS) to one of the drawing modes, select a color and away you go. 
  Take care which color slot you select as some are 'solid' and others not ... check the tip that appears.
  I find that if I'm doing tunnels or the like, using a Shape/Circle 5' works very nicely.
  If you draw with the wrong 'color' then you can swap them for another by first taking note of the from/to color number 
  which is at the end of the 'tip' the go to the System tab and down the bottom you can swap the colors over.
- There is an undo function in the "Sp. Action" menu on the top right of the map.
- Set the "Map Mode" (middle LHS) to combat.
- For each combat/encounter area:
  - add the monsters for that area in the Edit/Add tab. There are about 850 standard monsters already setup ready for you to
    use. Use the "Qk Monster Search" area to find and select them. Dont forget to assign an icon to them before adding them.
    If they are a non-standard monster, use either the "Qk Monster Add" or select "New Monster" and fill in all the details.
  - in the Combat tab select "Add NEW monsters here in a Group" in the popup menu (by right clicking on the
    location to add these monsters). Type in the room/group name and select "Add them as Disabled" as then they
    will not appear in any of the main lists throughout the program.
    You can add up to 70 groups/rooms. If you're doing more than that then select "Move all NEW monsters here" once you've
    reach the limit.
  - move each monster to their location.

To do a combat:
- move the players & monsters to their locations. Either drag the icons or use the popup menu. Note that you must grab an icon
  by the top left to drag/move it.
- If you've added them in as a group you can use the Group tab area to "Disable all except these" for the selected group. This
  will disable all the monsters except this group which will be enabled.
- in the Initiatives tab select "New Combat" and add the players initiatives rolls to their numbers. Then "Accept Initiatives"
  to setup the Init Lists.
- go to the Combat tab.
- if you have a second monitor attached, press the "Show XM" button and drag the player window to the other monitor. Maximize it.
- on the DM screen, zoom in/out both windows as required and select "Centre BOTH Maps here" from the popup menu.
- you'll see the initiative sequence on the left. As each one does their action they'll change color. You can select the one
  doing the current action by right-clicking on them either on the map or on the initiative sequence list.
- once you've completed all the actions for that round, press the "End of Round" button.

- when the combat has finished, calculate the XP in the "Qk Heal/XP/Enable" tab, then select either the "Clear Adjustments ..."
  or "Reset all for a new Combat" depending on the situation.
- to do mass player healings; in the "Qk Heal/XP/Enable" tab there's the Quick Heal area. Just refresh the list, type in the healing
  against each player and accept it.

Other procedural steps:
- after each 'day', you should select the "Reset all for a new Day" in the System tab. This will clear all the alerts, adjustments,
  heal them by level HP's etc. It pretty much clears/resets everything ready for a new day of adventuring
- in the "Qk Heal/XP/Enable" tab in the middle there is a list of special actions you can do

To do a Mass Combat
- when you add the army units, make sure you set the "#In Group" field before you add them. This number will then appear on the bottom RHS
  of the icon.
- just right-click anywhere on the combat grid and select "Do Mass Combat". Select who's attacking whom, "Calculate" and then adjust
  the defenders details based on how many have died. If you have hurt 'units' then I just set the current HP's to what's left and next
  time around remove it from that first.
	NB: the "# Died" adjusts the '#In Group' value by that amount but the 'HP:Curr' will set it to that.

Notes/quirks:
	- if you put the mouse pointer onto a player/monster on the map, in the "Combat/Map Messages" it will show you their details.
	- if you left click on two points on the map, in the "Combat/Map Messages" it will show you the distance between those points.

	- when you Zoom in/out it sometimes messes up the map scroll bars so you'll need to just find your map position again.

	- if you draw with the wrong 'color' then you can swap them for another by first taking note of the from/to color number 
	  which is at the end of the 'tip' the go to the System tab and down the bottom you can swap the colors over.

	- if you want to mess with your players heads, put random object icons (pentagrams etc) around your map and watch them scurry for cover :)

   - if you want to copy objects to say make a tree forest, select the Map Mode "Copy Object", select the one to copy and then where-ever
     you click, a copy will appear. Changes to one will effect all.

	***********************
	*** Menu/Tab Layout ***
	***********************

Combat - this is the main map area. Here you can draw a map, move players and monsters around and do the actual combat.

Initiatives
	New Combat/Initiatives - do this when you're starting a brand new combat. Add the players rolls to the values shown.
	Show new Monsters - if you've added more monsters or enabled some, then selecting this will show them. You'll need to 'Accept' next.
	Accept Initiative - accept the initiative rolls as listed. If someone delays their action, then change their value and 'Accept' them.

	All changes will be reflected in the Initiative List on the combat tab.

Groups - do group actions like assigning members to a group. Enabling all in a group etc.

Edit/Add - the main area for adding or changing players/monsters. You can add something by:
		- selecting the appropriate "New .." in the lists if you're doing a one off monster
		- select "Qk Monster Add" adding a number of the same monster. It will only ask for the necessary details. Don't forget to 
		  assign an icon to it. Useful if you're adding them from a purchased module.
		- there are over 840 monsters from the SRD and the like preloaded in the "Qk Monster Search" area. Type in the first few characters
		  of its name, select how many you want and assign an icon to be used then "Add them". There are also prerolled NPC characters in here
		  like Cleric 8th level and the like.

Other
	Auto Damage - here you can do automatic damage like ones that are done from Melfs Acid Arrow and the like.
	Mass Skill Check - seaching a room or seeing if the players spotted your ambush. Do a secret roll using either a rerolled d20 (from the Edit
		  tab) or use a random d20.
	Log File - if you've enabled the logging option in the System tab, you'll see all the details here.
	Qk Icon - forgotten to assign icons to all those giants, then select and assign an icon here.
	Mass Copy - this allows you to copy all or some of the details from one monster to another.
	Qk Spells - generate random spell lists.
	Monster Heal - do mass healings on monsters.

System - This is where you set program options, file names for saving/loading players, maps & monsters etc
   If you want to convert to using d100 systems, then select them from the Dice System field and change the Initiative System as required.
   Note: if you do this you'll need to "Save All" and restart the program as it modifies all the screens

Notes - write your campaign notes in here. It will be saved when you do a "Save All" in the System tab.

Dice Roller - roll random dice silently.

Status - show the status of all active ie. not disabled players and monsters.

Spell Adjustments
   Advanced - this is where you add adjustments of any kind. Use a predefined one or add a new one. Such things as Prayer, Bless,
	   Bears Endurance and the like, basically anything that effects BAB, Saves, HP, Damage etc can be configured here. Select who it effects,
   	duration and the parts to the adjustment ie. +3 BAB Morale, +2 Damage Enhancement.
   Quick - just put the value of the adjustments in the appropriate column for that player. Useful if they have time to pre-buff before combat.
	

SRD Text - if you've extracted a HTML SRD to the 'srd' directory then it will show in there. These are good ones to use are:
	http://www.systemreferencedocuments.org/35/stephenh.zip
	http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/srd/srd_revised_html/v35SRD_html.zip

	If you extract the SRD, it will look thro the 'spell' directory and build up a list for you to use in the Combat section.
   So when you do an action you can quick search and review the spell details.

Qk Heal/XP/Enable
	Quick Heal - after a combat there's lots of healing, so it's easy to do it here. It shows their real HP's ie. no adjustments.
	XP Calc - calculate how much XP the players have gotten from defeating the active monsters ie. those enabled.
	Special Actions - do such actions like clear, reset player & monsters.
	Enable/Disable - mass enable or disable monsters.

	Alerts - setup DM alerts that appear in the End of Round messages. Such things as when extra monsters appear or the like.
	Rnd Treasure - generate random treasure or specific items.
